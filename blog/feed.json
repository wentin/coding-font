A quick search would reveal <a href=\"https://kennethreitz.org/essays/2016/11/09/test-driving-a-200-programming-font-operator-mono\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">several posts</a> on the internet reviewing the font. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operator Mono is something I would like for my daily use; however, as a scrappy entrepreneur trying to build a startup, dropping $200 isn’t an option. Naturally, I looked for open source alternatives similar to Operator Mono that I can use in my code editor to increase workflow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before talking about good free alternatives to <a href=\"https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operator Mono</a>, I would like to point out its most unique design feature –– Operator Mono’s “true italic,” which improves the coding experience by making comments and keywords more quickly identifiable.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/operator-mono-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/operator-mono-2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/operator-mono-2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/operator-mono-2-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/operator-mono-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Operator Mono regular and Italic \" width=\"1088\" height=\"631\">\n<figcaption >Operator Mono regular and Italic </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monospaced Coding Font with True Italic</span></h1>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For context, italics come in two flavors: faux and true. Many fonts offer slightly slanted versions derived from the original letterforms. This slanted version of italic is called <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/essential-terms-you-must-know-about-typography#FauxFontStyle\">faux italic.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, true italics offer more visual distinctiveness:  Rather than simply slanted, they look very different from the fonts’ regular versions –– italic letters are distinctive. The <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/essential-terms-you-must-know-about-typography#FauxFontStyle\">true italic</a> takes inspiration from calligraphy or cursive writings in Operator Mono. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since many IDE themes use italics for comments and keywords, having uniquely different italics is incredibly helpful in making these stand out and easier to read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are three fantastic, free, and open-sourced coding fonts with true italics, similar to Operator Mono.</span></p>\n<h2>Victor Mono </h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Operator Mono, <a href=\"https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Victor Mono</a> takes inspiration from cursive style letterforms to create true italics that make keywords and comments stand out. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/victorMonoItalic.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/victorMonoItalic-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/victorMonoItalic-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/victorMonoItalic-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/victorMonoItalic-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Victor Mono Italics\" width=\"844\" height=\"227\">\n<figcaption >Victor Mono Italics</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div id=\"victor-mono-tester\" class=\"ele-font-tester paragraph-tester\"></div>\n<h2>IBM Plex Mono</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though cursive-style letters look distinct, they may not be the best reading experience for everyone. <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM Plex Mono</a> is a great coding font if you feel more at ease reading without the cursive letterforms.

With that said, there are also numerous </span><a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures-in-programming-fonts-hell-no.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some argue that using ligatures fiddle with the semantic meaning of code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a font, ligatures are special characters that combine two or more characters. For example, the letter \"f\" has a high frequency of appearing with \"i\" and \"l\", as in words like “figure” and “flower.” To improve the readability in these specific cases, font designers created ligatures as a solution - common letter combinations, like \"fi\" and \"fl\", would be combined to create a unique character that would replace the two letters when typed together. So, if a font has a ligature for arrow, “= &gt;”, the ligature “=&gt;” would replace the two characters, “=” and”&gt;.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Operator Mono does not currently support any ligatures, two of the fonts we featured in this post do –– Victor Mono and JetBrains Mono. Fira Code also has a popular ligature set that many programmers use to configure fonts like Operator Mono or Source Code Pro, which lacks programming ligatures of their own. </span></p>\n<h2>Victor Mono </h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to true italic, another bonus about Victor Mono is that it has programming ligatures that make things like arrow, \"=&gt;\",  easy. Coding ligature is a feature Operator Mono is yet to have. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/VictorMonoLig.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/VictorMonoLig-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/VictorMonoLig-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/VictorMonoLig-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/VictorMonoLig-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Victor Mono Programming Ligatures\" width=\"846\" height=\"338\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Victor Mono Programming Ligatures</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div id=\"victor-mono-lig-tester\" class=\"ele-font-tester paragraph-tester\"></div>\n<h2>JetBrains Mono</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JetBrains Mono features an excellent set of ligatures for programming to reduce the noise of multiple letters in your code.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/JetBrainsMonoLig-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/JetBrainsMonoLig-2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/JetBrainsMonoLig-2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/JetBrainsMonoLig-2-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/12/responsive/JetBrainsMonoLig-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"JetBrains Mono Programming Ligatures\" width=\"843\" height=\"229\"></figure>\n<figcaption >JetBrains Mono Programming Ligatures</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div id=\"jetbrains-mono-lig-tester\" class=\"ele-font-tester paragraph-tester\"></div>\n<h2>Fira Code</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fira Code</a> is one of the most popular coding fonts with ligatures.

You might be reading this because we just launched our preorder page for our app, <a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/\">Typogram</a>. Typogram is a design tool that we have been working on. Specifically, it’s a beginner-friendly logo design and editing tool for non-designers. <strong><em>Today, we are launching our pre-order. We are offering one brand lifetime license for $49.99, at 60% discount. You can create your brand inside our app and update it forever.</em></strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PHHaLh1zNU\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Why did we launch this? </h2>\n<p>First of all, a brief introduction: We are Hua and Wenting, and we are the makers behind this app. Before Typogram, we have collaborated on several other projects, like<a href=\"https://typogram.github.io/Anicons/\"> Anicons.</a></p>\n<p>We are both passionate designers that want to create easy-to-use design tools that enable people to feel fun and creative. We want to make design more accessible for non-designers. This launch is a special milestone because Typogram has been an idea in the works for a long time. We wanted to share our journey to this point so far.  </p>\n<h2>What was the start of Typogram?</h2>\n<p>Typogram started out as a professional tool for designers in its earliest stage. As we ran around with equipment and interviewed users, we realized that this app better served non-designers. We had met many newly minted business owners looking to launch their product with a presentable, eye-catching website branded with marketing and a unique logo. They needed their logos designed but didn’t know who to turn to. Many ended up designing logos themselves and complained about the lack of learning resources and an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly tool, geared especially for non-designers to design logos. </p>\n<p>After hearing about this pain point, we put our heads down to work by creating free design education resources for entrepreneurs, like<a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\"> FontDiscovery</a>, doing<a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/#about\"> workshops</a> at accelerators like Yale’s<a href=\"https://city.yale.edu/\"> Tsai City</a>, and co-working spaces, like<a href=\"https://www.the-wing.com/\"> the Wing</a>. In addition, we made mini design tools, like<a href=\"https://www.codingfont.com/\"> Coding Font</a>.  </p>\n<p>We also developed our features quickly using no-code tools and tested out our app with an initial group of customers. We brought users on-site, had them test out our apps, nervously observed their interactions with our app. When the pandemic hit, we user tested remotely. Eventually, we figured out what worked, what didn’t and built out the features with code! Our customers were happy with what we have and paid us.</p>\n<h2>What was the most challenging part of this launch? </h2>\n<p>As shy creatives and engineers, the most challenging aspect of this launch had two layers. First, putting ourselves out there in many unexpected ways, and second, internalized pressure of launching and the desire to be perfect. This was a massive project for us and required us to put ourselves out there consistently. An example is the making of landing page marketing and our product video. We wrote the script, recorded and edited ourselves as the audio, and assembled the footage with in-app recordings and self-made animations. Every single aspect challenged us to do something out of our comfort zone. We were lucky to have a supportive community and friends that challenged us every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Now that we feel more confident because our closed alpha customers were satisfied, we are ready to show everyone what we got! That brings us to this preorder launch. We are looking to share more about this journey as we go, all the ups and downs. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/8/emotionalJourney.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/emotionalJourney-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/emotionalJourney-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/emotionalJourney-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/emotionalJourney-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"the emotional journey of making a product\" width=\"1400\" height=\"896\">\n<figcaption ><em>source: <a href=\"https://x.company/blog/posts/the-monkey-the-tiger-beetle-and-the-language-of-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">x company Medium</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>How can I support? </h2>\n<p>Launching a business is hard –– It would mean a lot to us if you could support us!</p>\n<p><em><strong>The best way to support is through pre-ordering our product.

I am the co-founder and head engineer of <a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/\">Typogram</a>. I write a weekly newsletter about my entrepreneur developer journey; check it out <a href=\"https://wentin.substack.com/\">here</a>. Typogram helps non-designers—especially startup founders and small business owners—create a brand identity system including logo, color palette, and typography, all without paying for an expensive designer, or having to learn fancy design tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taking-coding-font-from-ideas-to-execution\"><strong>Taking Coding Font from ideas to execution</strong></h3>\n<p>As our company name suggests, our main product (currently under development) is heavily about typography, and indeed we spend most of our time dealing with fonts—validating them, tagging them, licensing them. Managing fonts internally was getting to be a challenge, to the point where we needed to build internal tools; that is when we met Retool.</p>\n<p>After using Retool to create internal font management tools, we quickly realized how powerful it was. We came up with the idea to create fun, one-off, low-budget consumer-facing apps that will generate traffic to our main website and product newsletters. The fact that Retool is low code empowered our team to hack around new ideas without over-commitment. It is a nice way to think outside of the box and have a little engineers’ fun!</p>\n<p>This is what we did.</p>\n<p>The first step was to get the fonts flowing in. With a fonts API, it is effortless to get the project off the ground by hooking up with the data source, and populating the data into Retool’s standard table component:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool_codingfont-2.gif\" alt=\"Populate table with font data\" width=\"1274\" height=\"594\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption>Populate table with font data</figcaption>\n\n<p>The table is currently showing only raw metadata about the fonts, such as the font family name, font styles, category, etc. While the metadata provides supporting information, the essence of a font is its visual design, which needs to be visually showcased. We have a font file URL field among the data fields, which we can use to create a live preview of the font. Let’s put that preview into a custom column.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool-codingfont-3.gif\" alt=\"Customize table column to render font preview\" width=\"1274\" height=\"594\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption>Customize table column to render font preview</figcaption>\n\n<p>Each column of the table component can be customized freely. There are two levels of customization:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Standard options, including Boolean, Button, Checkbox, Date, Dropdown, Integer, URL, Object, String, Text Input…</li>\n<li>Customization by turning on “Render cell as pure HTML” provides almost unlimited possibilities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I like the convenience provided by #1—the long list of supported data formats and presentation styles solves for 90 percent of the use cases. I also enjoy the flexibility provided by #2, and it is what I used to render a live preview of the font using the font file URL.

But since then, I have discovered no code and low code apps which are essentially libraries of pre-existing informational or functional things.  They can be powered by a database or an API, and the interaction layer is standard, often with minimal customization needs. That library of functional things in this case is coding fonts. Our idea was perfect for a low code execution.</p>\n<p>Does that mean low code is replacing coding? In my opinion, low code platforms are not replacing coding. They are instead creating an entirely new market. Many products that would have never been developed in the traditional hand-coded way now have a chance to see the light of day. Some examples include apps serving a small number of users that would not be economical to hand-code from the ground up. Without low code, these problems are often not worth solving. In the banking and finance industry, there is “too big to fail”; in product making, there was “too small to exist.” However, that is being changed by the no code / low code movement!</p>\n<p>I am also seeing a new generation of platforms like Retool that are more open-minded and open-ended. They are not enclosed systems and offer freedom to go off the road by systematically allowing users to write custom code and components. They are endlessly configurable and expandable, intended for engineers and developers of all levels. I am looking forward to witnessing where low code takes us next!</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://retool.com/blog/how-i-created-a-coding-font-game-with-low-code/\">Retool’s blog</a>.</em></p>\n",

With this self-awareness, I need to remind myself what is more prioritized in a landing page design — it is conversion; it is to achieve business goals; it is NOT trying to win an Awwwards. I found there are four essential elements to a good landing page design:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-straightforward-call-to-action\">1. Straightforward Call to Action</h2>\n<p>A good landing page should have a straightforward, simple, and preferably single Call to Action above the fold. Above the fold means the Call to Action should be visible without having to scroll down. It should be paired up with a clear value proposition conveyed by hero images or videos— the above-the-fold section functions as a mini landing page within the landing page. It is designed to capture the core targeted users who can be convinced at first glance. \n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_d3e47a09-dfc6-48fc-8043-71ac13aa10c6_657x409.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_d3e47a09-dfc6-48fc-8043-71ac13aa10c6_657x409-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_d3e47a09-dfc6-48fc-8043-71ac13aa10c6_657x409-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_d3e47a09-dfc6-48fc-8043-71ac13aa10c6_657x409-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_d3e47a09-dfc6-48fc-8043-71ac13aa10c6_657x409-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"A landing page without a call to action above the fold\" width=\"657\" height=\"409\" /></figure>\nimg: A landing page without a call to action above the fold</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd91f302-4b20-4a09-a281-95c94fdff510_657x433.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd91f302-4b20-4a09-a281-95c94fdff510_657x433-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd91f302-4b20-4a09-a281-95c94fdff510_657x433-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd91f302-4b20-4a09-a281-95c94fdff510_657x433-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd91f302-4b20-4a09-a281-95c94fdff510_657x433-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"A landing page with a call to action above the fold\" width=\"657\" height=\"433\" /></figure>\nimg: A landing page with a call to action above the fold</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-reasons-to-click-on-call-to-action\">2.

Sometimes, we are unlucky that we don’t meet our customers at the right time or the right place, but it doesn’t mean we won’t get a second chance further down the road. Strike a good impression, and prepare for our second encounter. Leave a good lasting impression that we are competent and delightful with beautiful site design and clear value proposition.

People may not judge a book by its cover, but the book cover certainly affects whether or not people will pick up the book and flip through the pages.

One thing is for sure, people love to monospace fonts because some of these issues are our most popular. Here is a recap of the monospaced issues we have covered so far. You can try these fonts for as coding fonts, fonts for your web, app, or design projects and fonts for your branding and startup. </p>\n<h3>Noto Sans Mono</h3>\n<p>We covered Noto in <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/noto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FontDiscovery issue 42</a><a href=\"https://fonts.substack.com/p/noto\" rel=\"\"></a>. It is a joint project by several big tech companies (Google, Adobe, and Monotype) to eliminate “Tofu,” which is the box that shows up when there is a missing character. Taking the neutral tone and style elements from the Noto Sans, Noto Sans Mono is neutral and inviting. The monospaced version of Noto Sans is also available. It has several weights and italics for you to use. And you can toggle ligature if you need to. </p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Humanist sans serif influence (calligraphy)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Numeric “0” with crossbars to differentiate from letter “O”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ac2d36-bdaa-4aed-8471-84219d23b06f_1349x462.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"462\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68ac2d36-bdaa-4aed-8471-84219d23b06f_1349x462.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:1349,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27603,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: font-details of Noto Mono</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cb0b88d-9ecf-430f-98c6-662735bc1c4d_716x462.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"462\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cb0b88d-9ecf-430f-98c6-662735bc1c4d_716x462.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:716,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: Reddit homepage uses IBM Plex Sans for the link titles and most of the interface.

Compared with Noto Sans Mono, IBM Plex Mono feels more “rigid” with serifs on the letters.</p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Curved tails in “l,” “z,” and “Q” for monospace italic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dotted numeric “0” to differentiate from the letter “O”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84d6ac28-b79d-4136-9196-b15b4b9deea1_1349x462.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"462\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84d6ac28-b79d-4136-9196-b15b4b9deea1_1349x462.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:1349,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27799,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: type details of Plex Mono.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99a1974c-5873-4247-af68-2544aff461a2_1074x694.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"694\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99a1974c-5873-4247-af68-2544aff461a2_1074x694.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:694,&quot;width&quot;:1074,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: hackernoon uses are Plex for its site.

It spices up the idea of monospaced fonts with its pronounced serifs and ball terminals that I haven’t seen in others. It brings an extra sense of elegance and grandeur to designs as a display font for headers. As a coding font, I think it’s an acquired taste. Because of its large serifs, I find Xanh Mono uncomfortable to stare at them for hours when coding. However, if you want to spice up your editor, give it a try.</p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Transitional serifs with ball terminals </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only one weight with true italic </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b3d13b0-762b-4091-bb73-289d0aa4ea8f_716x462.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"326.4972067039106\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b3d13b0-762b-4091-bb73-289d0aa4ea8f_716x462.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:716,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:506,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: ball terminal on lowercase</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc671ad8-bddf-4ede-bf26-8ba662b6c21f_1349x462.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"462\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc671ad8-bddf-4ede-bf26-8ba662b6c21f_1349x462.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:1349,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: true italic lowercase letters of Xanh Mono</p>\n<h3>Space Mono</h3>\n<p>While monospaced fonts sound techy and nerdy, they also appear intimate and friendly in specific contexts. Reasons could be the extra comfort to our eyes brought by its fixed width or remembrance of memories past when we click-clacked our thoughts to our loved ones.  Either way, monospaced fonts are having a comeback. People love using them in their brands.</p>\n<p>Space Mono (<a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fontdiscovery-21-tips-about-using\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issue 21</a>) is an excellent example of this. It is a cute, eclectic, friendly monospace font combining geometric perfection with the human touch. The shapes of the letters are very geometric but with a funky calligraphic influence of grotesque sans serifs. Human touch like these makes Space Mono perfect for friendly tech brands. </p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Geometric, almost retro-looking letters with funky calligraphic influence </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dotted numeric “0” to differentiate from “O”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-499-728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82934b26-425a-479d-b46c-d65997ca77b4_1456x499.png\"><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82934b26-425a-479d-b46c-d65997ca77b4_1456x499.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"499\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82934b26-425a-479d-b46c-d65997ca77b4_1456x499.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>img: font details for space mono. </p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure><figure class=\"sizing-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20469e15-e49f-4bf9-b33e-ea02c03e4c8d_1600x1067.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"971\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20469e15-e49f-4bf9-b33e-ea02c03e4c8d_1600x1067.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}\"></figure></figure>\n<p>img: Data display using Space Mono. source: Google Design</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>If you enjoyed this post, you can also subscribe our <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FontDiscovery newsletter</a>, where we share weekly tips about font and design.</strong></p>\n</div>",

Having a coding font that works for us while programming reduces our eye fatigue, increases productivity, and makes the code cleaner. In this post, we go over our favorite coding fonts and talk about the details of each, so you can decide which is the best for you. But first, for some background, let’s talk briefly about the history of monospaced fonts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-history-of-monospaced-fonts\">The History of Monospaced Fonts</h2>\n<p>Monospaced fonts are fonts with the same fixed width. The earliest form originated to suit the needs of mechanical typewriters, which had a carriage that moved the paper the same distance every time someone pressed a key.</p>\n<p>Even though electric typewriters were introduced later with more choices of fonts, monospaced fonts stayed relevant. Their utilitarian functionality was easy to transfer to new technologies, especially the earliest computers because they had limited display capabilities.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ns3iHtTgnzX_k2xLLP6OWgryZhNedxvbay45viYXyfillLMVPS8lhKGlgIERisBL2y1ubYoN7s8A_zWYiNYA9GT69stxAr2fQfFPjio4-jlDECkA_9of07fuuZ4tJwsuabZCExLY\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ns3iHtTgnzX_k2xLLP6OWgryZhNedxvbay45viYXyfillLMVPS8lhKGlgIERisBL2y1ubYoN7s8A_zWYiNYA9GT69stxAr2fQfFPjio4-jlDECkA_9of07fuuZ4tJwsuabZCExLY\"></p>\n<p>Img: IBM Selectric is one of the most successful typewriters ever made.

Here are our top three favorites, featured on this website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-fira-code\">Fira Code</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fira Code</a> is a great coding font. We love the ligatures in Fira Code. Typically, things like <code>=&gt;</code> would require two characters, <code>=</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. The ligature feature allows this combination of characters to be displayed as a single, connected character. Having ligatures reduces the noise and makes code blocks look extra neat and clean. Also, Fira Code has additional support for ASCII drawings and console UIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Font Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code-friendly ligatures for things like <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>www</code>, <code>=&gt;</code> and more.</li>\n<li>Crossbar numeric “0”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TOtfeQw7-lxvYBS05v-fQTj-_JsWQ0QI8ylsP-yV-uSfSpaDUXomzQKd-mSRci9UKW1AE7qfCF7Nu8DOcQeT-zSsa2jJFR--jaSCeLWFBibnNdBH0oEwaOqpIMqHOqMgNe41AtJb\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TOtfeQw7-lxvYBS05v-fQTj-_JsWQ0QI8ylsP-yV-uSfSpaDUXomzQKd-mSRci9UKW1AE7qfCF7Nu8DOcQeT-zSsa2jJFR--jaSCeLWFBibnNdBH0oEwaOqpIMqHOqMgNe41AtJb\"></p>\n<p>Img: Fira Code in use.
