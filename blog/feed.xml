                <p><em><strong>About Author:</strong></em> 
<em>Hi, I am Wenting Zhang. I recently quit my job of seven years to build my start-up, Typogram, logo design and editing tool for startup founders and absolute beginners. We just launched our pre-order.✨ If you want to stay in touch, sign-up for my build-up-public updates.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As engineers, we spend a lot of time in front of our computer screens. The coding font that we spend 8 hours a day staring at has a lot to do with our productivity and comfort. I am very picky about coding fonts and like to experiment with that setting to find the best balance. You too? That’s great because I made an app just for you! I will go through how we create <a href="https://codingfont.com/">CodingFont.com</a>—a gamified experience that helps you find your true love amongst coding fonts.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool_codingfont-1-2.gif" alt="The winning screen of the coding font tournament" width="906" height="480" /></figure></p>
<figcaption>The winning screen of the coding font tournament</figcaption>

<p>First off, a little introduction. I am the co-founder and head engineer of <a href="https://www.typogram.co/">Typogram</a>. I write a weekly newsletter about my entrepreneur developer journey; check it out <a href="https://wentin.substack.com/">here</a>. Typogram helps non-designers—especially startup founders and small business owners—create a brand identity system including logo, color palette, and typography, all without paying for an expensive designer, or having to learn fancy design tools.</p>
<h3 id="taking-coding-font-from-ideas-to-execution"><strong>Taking Coding Font from ideas to execution</strong></h3>
<p>As our company name suggests, our main product (currently under development) is heavily about typography, and indeed we spend most of our time dealing with fonts—validating them, tagging them, licensing them. Managing fonts internally was getting to be a challenge, to the point where we needed to build internal tools; that is when we met Retool.</p>
<p>After using Retool to create internal font management tools, we quickly realized how powerful it was. We came up with the idea to create fun, one-off, low-budget consumer-facing apps that will generate traffic to our main website and product newsletters. The fact that Retool is low code empowered our team to hack around new ideas without over-commitment. It is a nice way to think outside of the box and have a little engineers’ fun!</p>
<p>This is what we did.</p>
<p>The first step was to get the fonts flowing in. With a fonts API, it is effortless to get the project off the ground by hooking up with the data source, and populating the data into Retool’s standard table component:</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool_codingfont-2.gif" alt="Populate table with font data" width="1274" height="594" /></figure></p>
<figcaption>Populate table with font data</figcaption>

<p>The table is currently showing only raw metadata about the fonts, such as the font family name, font styles, category, etc. While the metadata provides supporting information, the essence of a font is its visual design, which needs to be visually showcased. We have a font file URL field among the data fields, which we can use to create a live preview of the font. Let’s put that preview into a custom column.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool-codingfont-3.gif" alt="Customize table column to render font preview" width="1274" height="594" /></figure></p>
<figcaption>Customize table column to render font preview</figcaption>

<p>Each column of the table component can be customized freely. There are two levels of customization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standard options, including Boolean, Button, Checkbox, Date, Dropdown, Integer, URL, Object, String, Text Input…</li>
<li>Customization by turning on “Render cell as pure HTML” provides almost unlimited possibilities</li>
</ol>
<p>I like the convenience provided by #1—the long list of supported data formats and presentation styles solves for 90 percent of the use cases. I also enjoy the flexibility provided by #2, and it is what I used to render a live preview of the font using the font file URL. I created a @font-face using the font file URL, then applied this font to the HTML element:</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool-codingfont-4.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-4-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-4-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-4-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-4-lg.png 1024w"  alt="fontFace" width="1161" height="764" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="gamifying-your-coding-font-choices"><strong>Gamifying your coding font choices</strong></h3>
<p>However, simply previewing a list of coding fonts is not enough to attract users; I wanted to spice it up and provide a unique app experience to make it worth people’s time.As trained as my eyes are after working with fonts for many years, I still feel helpless when choosing fonts from a long list. Some subtle differences between them are hardly noticeable. That rings especially true for coding fonts, as they inherently share the mono-spaced characteristics already.</p>
<p>But what if you could look at only two fonts at a time, picking the better one, then rinsing and repeating in a “tournament style” until you have the winner?</p>
<p>I assigned the fonts into pairs; just like in the Squid Game, if the total number of players (aka fonts) is odd, the unpaired player automatically wins that round and gets to the next.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool-codingfont-5.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-5-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-5-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-5-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-5-lg.png 1024w"  alt="fontPair" width="1161" height="548" /></figure></p>
<p>Each pair is then battled out in a side by side UI for easy comparison:</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/retool-codingfont-6.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-6-xs.png 300w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-6-sm.png 480w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-6-md.png 768w ,https://www.codingfont.com/blog/media/posts/7/responsive/retool-codingfont-6-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Side by side font comparison" width="1456" height="772" /></figure></p>
<figcaption>Side by side font comparison</figcaption>

<p>After you select the round’s winner, the button click will automatically trigger a query to fetch the next font pair recursively until there is only one font left, which is the winner and hopefully your next coding font!</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8725018b-8b4d-48f1-bacf-7c015214b0bb_906x480.gif" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Play the font tournament rounds" /></figure></p>

<h3 id="why-i-built-it-with-retool"><strong>Why I built it with Retool</strong></h3>
<p>Five years ago, if I wanted to build this coding font game, I would have had to spend days or weeks hand-coding it in React or other frameworks. But since then, I have discovered no code and low code apps which are essentially libraries of pre-existing informational or functional things.  They can be powered by a database or an API, and the interaction layer is standard, often with minimal customization needs. That library of functional things in this case is coding fonts. Our idea was perfect for a low code execution.</p>
<p>Does that mean low code is replacing coding? In my opinion, low code platforms are not replacing coding. They are instead creating an entirely new market. Many products that would have never been developed in the traditional hand-coded way now have a chance to see the light of day. Some examples include apps serving a small number of users that would not be economical to hand-code from the ground up. Without low code, these problems are often not worth solving. In the banking and finance industry, there is “too big to fail”; in product making, there was “too small to exist.” However, that is being changed by the no code / low code movement!</p>
<p>I am also seeing a new generation of platforms like Retool that are more open-minded and open-ended. They are not enclosed systems and offer freedom to go off the road by systematically allowing users to write custom code and components. They are endlessly configurable and expandable, intended for engineers and developers of all levels. I am looking forward to witnessing where low code takes us next!</p>

                <p><em><strong>About Author:</strong></em> 
<em>Hi, I am Wenting Zhang. I recently quit my job of seven years to build my start-up, Typogram, logo design and editing tool for startup founders and absolute beginners. We just launched our pre-order.✨ If you want to stay in touch, sign-up for my build-up-public updates.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At <a href="https://typogram.co/">Typogram</a>, we are currently working on a pre-order landing page to be launched in February. As we design the landing page, we look through a lot of successful landing page examples and try to learn from their successes.</p>
<p>I am a design-focused and crafty person who could easily be carried away by visual design choices such as typography and layout. With this self-awareness, I need to remind myself what is more prioritized in a landing page design — it is conversion; it is to achieve business goals; it is NOT trying to win an Awwwards. I found there are four essential elements to a good landing page design:</p>
<h2 id="1-straightforward-call-to-action">1. Straightforward Call to Action</h2>
<p>A good landing page should have a straightforward, simple, and preferably single Call to Action above the fold. Above the fold means the Call to Action should be visible without having to scroll down. It should be paired up with a clear value proposition conveyed by hero images or videos— the above-the-fold section functions as a mini landing page within the landing page. It is designed to capture the core targeted users who can be convinced at first glance.

<p>For people who are not convinced at first glance at the above-the-fold section, they might be intrigued enough to scroll down.

<h2 id="3-a-good-lasting-impression">3. A good lasting impression.</h2>
<p>Not all site visitors will be converted to customers on the first go. Sometimes, we are unlucky that we don’t meet our customers at the right time or the right place, but it doesn’t mean we won’t get a second chance further down the road. Strike a good impression, and prepare for our second encounter. Leave a good lasting impression that we are competent and delightful with beautiful site design and clear value proposition. When it comes to a time when they are in need of us, there is a better chance for us to be thought of. </p>
<h2 id="4-good-seo">4. Good SEO</h2>
<p>All of the above elements are to convert people who have already landed on the landing page. The last element — good SEO — is to ensure more people will end up in the landing page. Think of SEO as the cover of the book and the landing page as the content of the book. People may not judge a book by its cover, but the book cover certainly affects whether or not people will pick up the book and flip through the pages. Good SEO is like a good book cover, it gets people to flip through your book.</p>

<p>We covered monospaced fonts many times in our beloved <a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FontDiscovery newsletter</a>. <em>(See our <a href="https://www.codingfont.com/blog/best-coding-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> if you need a quick refresher on the history of monospaced fonts.) </em>Some are a part of an extensive font family, some standing strong on their own. One thing is for sure, people love to monospace fonts because some of these issues are our most popular. Here is a recap of the monospaced issues we have covered so far. You can try these fonts for as coding fonts, fonts for your web, app, or design projects and fonts for your branding and startup. </p>
<h3>Noto Sans Mono</h3>
<p>We covered Noto in <a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/noto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FontDiscovery issue 42</a><a href="https://fonts.substack.com/p/noto" rel=""></a>. It is a joint project by several big tech companies (Google, Adobe, and Monotype) to eliminate “Tofu,” which is the box that shows up when there is a missing character. Taking the neutral tone and style elements from the Noto Sans, Noto Sans Mono is neutral and inviting. The monospaced version of Noto Sans is also available. It has several weights and italics for you to use. And you can toggle ligature if you need to. </p>

<h3>IBM Plex Mono </h3>
<p>Like Noto Sans Mono, IBM Plex Mono (<a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fontdiscovery-13-plex-a-font-family" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue 13</a>) benefits from being in a large font family: it has several weights and italics. Plex is extensive because IBM originally used it as its branding font. IBM wanted to illustrate the themes of humanity and machine. The font mirrored this brand vision by having neutral and balanced weights with more friendly italics. Compared with Noto Sans Mono, IBM Plex Mono feels more “rigid” with serifs on the letters.</p>

<h3>Xanh Mono</h3>
<p>Xanh Mono (<a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fontdiscovery-36-a-font-for-coding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue 36</a>)is a unique monospaced font. It spices up the idea of monospaced fonts with its pronounced serifs and ball terminals that I haven’t seen in others. It brings an extra sense of elegance and grandeur to designs as a display font for headers. As a coding font, I think it’s an acquired taste. Because of its large serifs, I find Xanh Mono uncomfortable to stare at them for hours when coding. However, if you want to spice up your editor, give it a try.</p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transitional serifs with ball terminals </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one weight with true italic </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Space Mono</h3>
<p>While monospaced fonts sound techy and nerdy, they also appear intimate and friendly in specific contexts. Reasons could be the extra comfort to our eyes brought by its fixed width or remembrance of memories past when we click-clacked our thoughts to our loved ones.  Either way, monospaced fonts are having a comeback. People love using them in their brands.</p>
<p>Space Mono (<a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fontdiscovery-21-tips-about-using" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue 21</a>) is an excellent example of this. It is a cute, eclectic, friendly monospace font combining geometric perfection with the human touch. The shapes of the letters are very geometric but with a funky calligraphic influence of grotesque sans serifs. Human touch like these makes Space Mono perfect for friendly tech brands. </p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Geometric, almost retro-looking letters with funky calligraphic influence </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dotted numeric “0” to differentiate from “O”</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We spent so much time working inside our code editors every day as engineers. Having a coding font that works for us while programming reduces our eye fatigue, increases productivity, and makes the code cleaner. In this post, we go over our favorite coding fonts and talk about the details of each, so you can decide which is the best for you. But first, for some background, let’s talk briefly about the history of monospaced fonts.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-history-of-monospaced-fonts">The History of Monospaced Fonts</h2>
<p>Monospaced fonts are fonts with the same fixed width. The earliest form originated to suit the needs of mechanical typewriters, which had a carriage that moved the paper the same distance every time someone pressed a key.</p>
<p>Even though electric typewriters were introduced later with more choices of fonts, monospaced fonts stayed relevant. Their utilitarian functionality was easy to transfer to new technologies, especially the earliest computers because they had limited display capabilities.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ns3iHtTgnzX_k2xLLP6OWgryZhNedxvbay45viYXyfillLMVPS8lhKGlgIERisBL2y1ubYoN7s8A_zWYiNYA9GT69stxAr2fQfFPjio4-jlDECkA_9of07fuuZ4tJwsuabZCExLY" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ns3iHtTgnzX_k2xLLP6OWgryZhNedxvbay45viYXyfillLMVPS8lhKGlgIERisBL2y1ubYoN7s8A_zWYiNYA9GT69stxAr2fQfFPjio4-jlDECkA_9of07fuuZ4tJwsuabZCExLY"></p>

<h2 id="heading-typograms-picks">Typogram’s Picks</h2>
<p>Nowadays, we find monospaced fonts in terminals and code editors like Sublime or VS Code as our coding fonts. Here are our top three favorites, featured on this website.</p>
<h3 id="heading-fira-code">Fira Code</h3>
<p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fira Code</a> is a great coding font. We love the ligatures in Fira Code. Typically, things like <code>=&gt;</code> would require two characters, <code>=</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. The ligature feature allows this combination of characters to be displayed as a single, connected character. Having ligatures reduces the noise and makes code blocks look extra neat and clean. Also, Fira Code has additional support for ASCII drawings and console UIs.</p>
<p><strong>Font Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code-friendly ligatures for things like <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>www</code>, <code>=&gt;</code> and more.</li>
<li>Crossbar numeric “0”</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TOtfeQw7-lxvYBS05v-fQTj-_JsWQ0QI8ylsP-yV-uSfSpaDUXomzQKd-mSRci9UKW1AE7qfCF7Nu8DOcQeT-zSsa2jJFR--jaSCeLWFBibnNdBH0oEwaOqpIMqHOqMgNe41AtJb" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TOtfeQw7-lxvYBS05v-fQTj-_JsWQ0QI8ylsP-yV-uSfSpaDUXomzQKd-mSRci9UKW1AE7qfCF7Nu8DOcQeT-zSsa2jJFR--jaSCeLWFBibnNdBH0oEwaOqpIMqHOqMgNe41AtJb"></p>

<h3 id="heading-cousine">Cousine</h3>
<p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cousine</a> is a favorite programming font of mine. Cousine is a sans serif that matches metrically to the width of Courier new. Being a sans serif, Cousine lacks the harshness of serifs and ornate details of letters. It looks very comforting to the eye in large blocks of code.</p>
<p><strong>Font Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dotted numeric “0”</li>
<li>Sans serif makes it easy reading</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/idNj--awTINfXh_2AExYArkQRrzqbMYIEu_czgIpTIoAobhedl9kcBfgorwXt61L_yR3EeOQ2Xvfpz7jmPjiaX3R_ISEya1Z6e1cRUkAO0ki5_YqCRZvZOPE67JDLc-SrAjDRKQo" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/idNj--awTINfXh_2AExYArkQRrzqbMYIEu_czgIpTIoAobhedl9kcBfgorwXt61L_yR3EeOQ2Xvfpz7jmPjiaX3R_ISEya1Z6e1cRUkAO0ki5_YqCRZvZOPE67JDLc-SrAjDRKQo"></p>

<h3 id="heading-jet-brains-mono">Jet Brains Mono</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JetBrains</a> is an impressive coding font with eight weights. One feature of this font is that the lowercase letters have maximized height. This feature reduces the length of code displayed in the editors, making the code more comfortable to read.</p>
<p><strong>Font Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dotted numeric “0”</li>
<li>Code-friendly ligatures</li>
<li>maximized lowercase height and cut oval shape to make reading code easier</li>
</ul>
